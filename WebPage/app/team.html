                    I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development at the University of Utah, where my
                    coursework has included mobile and web development, computer security, networking, and database
                    management.

                <br>
                <small>
                    Over the past year, I've been a key contributor to the SOUR project, primarily serving as a backend
                    engineer. My responsibilities have included designing core APIs and database schemas, as well as
                    developing our search functionality and related-content recommendation algorithm. In addition to my
                    coursework, I work with the Identity and Access Management (IAM) team in the university’s IT
                    department. In this role, I provision cloud accounts and Duo Mobile accounts, manage group access
                    using Grouper, and efficiently resolve user support tickets.

                <br>
                <small>
                    My technical interests lie in backend development and database systems. Recently, I've developed a
                    strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, fields I plan to explore more
                    deeply after graduation. I'm particularly motivated by opportunities to build applications that have
                    meaningful, real-world impacts and improve the lives of as many people as possible.

                    I am a graduating senior at the University of Utah, earning a degree in Software Development with a
                    minor in Arts Technology. My academic focus has been on web and mobile development, where I've
                    explored the intersection of technology, design, and user experience. I enjoy creating intuitive,
                    engaging digital products that solve real-world problems through thoughtful design and
                    functionality.

                <small>
                    For my capstone project, I helped develop SOUR, a thrifting-based social media and e-commerce
                    platform that connects users through curated fashion and sustainable shopping. This project
                    highlights my passion for meaningful, community-driven technology and my ability to work on both the
                    technical and creative sides of development.

                <small>
                    I’m particularly interested in UX/UI design and full-stack development, with hands-on experience
                    using tools like React and React Native to build responsive, dynamic applications. With a background
                    in arts technology and graphic design, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to every project and
                    strive to create work that is not only functional but impactful.
