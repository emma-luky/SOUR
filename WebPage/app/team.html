                     I am a graduating senior at the University of Utah, earning a degree in Software Development with a minor in Arts Technology. My academic focus has been on web and mobile development, where I've explored the intersection of technology, design, and user experience. I enjoy creating intuitive, engaging digital products that solve real-world problems through thoughtful design and functionality.

                    For my capstone project, I helped develop SOUR, a thrifting-based social media and e-commerce platform that connects users through curated fashion and sustainable shopping. This project highlights my passion for meaningful, community-driven technology and my ability to work on both the technical and creative sides of development.

                    Iâ€™m particularly interested in UX/UI design and full-stack development, with hands-on experience using tools like React and React Native to build responsive, dynamic applications. With a background in arts technology and graphic design, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to every project and strive to create work that is not only functional but impactful.
